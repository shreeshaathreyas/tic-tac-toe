# Tic-Tac-Toe Game in C++

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in C++.

## How to Play
- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Players take turns marking their position with `X` or `O`.
- The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) wins.
- If all 9 squares are filled and no player has 3 in a row, the game ends in a draw.

## How to Run
1. Compile the program using `g++`:
   ```bash
   g++ -o tic_tac_toe tic_tac_toe.cpp
